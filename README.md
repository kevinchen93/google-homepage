# Google Homepage Project

This purpose of this project was to deconstruct and rebuild a web page as accurately as possible.
The provided web page was the [Google homepage](https://www.google.com/) at the time.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).


## Pre-Project Thoughts

Note: At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tools, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

One thing the page is definitely missing is responsive design.
I will learn that later on in the curriculum.

Skills I demonstrated at project end: <br>
-HTML <br>
-CSS  <br>
-Use of Chrome Developer Tools
